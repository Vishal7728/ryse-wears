RYSE WEARS - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
============================

✅ YOUR PROJECT IS READY FOR DEPLOYMENT!

Frontend Status: ✅ Working with mock data
Backend Status: ⚠️  MongoDB connection issue (frontend works without it)
Images: ✅ All 62 images properly named and placed

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

1. DEPLOY TO VERCEL:
   a. Go to https://vercel.com
   b. Sign in or create account
   c. Click "New Project"
   d. Import your GitHub repository (Vishal7728/ryse-wears)
   e. Configure project:
      - Framework: Next.js
      - Root directory: frontend
   f. Set Environment Variables:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.vercel.app (set after backend deploy)
   g. Deploy!

2. DEPLOY BACKEND TO VERCEL (or other platform):
   a. Create new project in Vercel
   b. Root directory: backend
   c. Set Environment Variables:
      MONGODB_URL = mongodb+srv://kumaradik37_db_user:Vishal4624@cluster0.llvzmeq.mongodb.net/ryse_wears?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
      JWT_SECRET = ryse_wears_secret_key
      PORT = 5000
      NODE_ENV = production
      FRONTEND_URL = https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
      BACKEND_URL = https://your-backend-url.vercel.app

3. UPDATE FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT:
   a. Go to frontend project settings in Vercel
   b. Update NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL with your actual backend URL
   c. Redeploy frontend

MONGODB FIX (for production):
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas: https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Navigate to "Database Access"
3. Verify user "kumaradik37_db_user" exists with password "Vishal4624"
4. Ensure user has "Read and Write to any database" permissions
5. Go to "Network Access"
6. Add your current IP address to whitelist
7. Or add "0.0.0.0/0" to allow all IPs (less secure)
